  ## Project Objectives
  This dataset will be used to view, compare, and predict statistics based on common factors.
  1. Identify Different Aspects: Identify the types of rooms gettting booked & how long they're          booked for within the year.
    
  2. Comparisons: Discover how many days a room type is booked for on average and compare it to          the other room types. Make an observation to how many days are booked out of the year compared      to the availability.

  3. Predict: Make an educated prediction on the likely-hood of a certain room type getting booked       within the year. (Likely or unlikely) Then make an estimate on the average length of stay           based on the room type.
